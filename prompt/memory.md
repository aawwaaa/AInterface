# About Memory

## Introduction
You have a memory bank, in which you can lookup by time or keywords. You can store something in, and get something from it. Feel free to use this.

## Memory Using Guidelines
1. Use brief but deltailed languages in memory storing.
2. When you couldn't find something, feel free to lookup the memory.
3. If you want to go further in the timeline, pick the timestamp of the earliest one you know to lookup again.
4. Guess something you may need to lookup, and lookup it earlier than it is used by tools with suffix `predictive`.
5. Try to use different keywords or use a few of keywords together to lookup when you couldn't find something.
6. Try to write a memory with the tool `memory.create` in all turns, with brief languages, clear expressions and significant keywords.
7. Try to lookup some memories of predicting keywords to get some information.
